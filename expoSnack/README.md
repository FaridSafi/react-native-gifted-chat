## 🎨 Customization

The example includes several customizable components that you can modify:

### Colors & Theming
The app automatically adapts to your device's color scheme (light/dark mode). You can customize the colors in the `styles` object:

```typescript
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff', // Light mode background
  },
  containerDark: {
    backgroundColor: '#000', // Dark mode background
  },
  // ... more styles
})
```

### Message Data
Initial messages are defined in the `initialMessages` array. You can modify or add more messages:

```typescript
const initialMessages: IMessage[] = [
  {
    _id: 1,
    text: 'Your message here',
    createdAt: new Date(),
    user: {
      _id: 2,
      name: 'Bot Name',
    },
  },
  // ... more messages
]
```

### User Configuration
The current user is defined in the `user` object:

```typescript
const user = useMemo(() => ({
  _id: 1,
  name: 'Developer',
}), [])
```

## 📱 Platform Support

This example works on:
- ✅ iOS (simulator and device)
- ✅ Android (emulator and device)
- ⚠️ Web (limited - maps and some media features may not work)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Permissions Issues
If image picker or location features don't work:
1. Make sure you've granted the necessary permissions in your device settings
2. On iOS simulator, you may need to set a custom location
3. On Android emulator, enable location services

### Dependencies Not Installing
If dependencies fail to install in Expo Snack:
1. Try refreshing the page
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Try using a different browser
4. Check Expo Snack status at [status.expo.dev](https://status.expo.dev)

### Maps Not Displaying
Maps may not work on web or some simulators:
1. Use a physical device for best results
2. On Android emulator, enable Google Play Services
3. On iOS simulator, maps should work by default

## 📖 Code Structure

The `ExpoSnack.tsx` file is organized into these sections:

1. **Imports**: All required dependencies
2. **Data**: Initial messages and earlier messages
3. **Media Utilities**: Functions for image picker, camera, and location
4. **CustomView**: Component for rendering map locations
5. **CustomActions**: Action button component with action sheet
6. **AccessoryBar**: Bottom toolbar component
7. **ChatExample**: Main chat component
8. **App**: Root component with ActionSheetProvider

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once you have this working, you can:

1. Customize the styling to match your app
2. Connect to a real backend (Firebase, Socket.io, etc.)
3. Add more custom message types
4. Implement message persistence
5. Add user authentication
6. Implement push notifications

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

When using in Expo Snack:
- File sizes may be limited
- Some native modules may not work
- Performance may be slower than a local app
- Network requests may be restricted

For production apps, it's recommended to use this as a starting point and develop locally with Expo CLI or React Native CLI.

## 💡 Tips

1. **Test on a real device**: Many features work better on physical devices
2. **Use the Expo Go app**: Scan the QR code with Expo Go for best results
3. **Check console for errors**: Open the console in Expo Snack to see any errors
4. **Experiment**: Modify the code and see changes in real-time!
