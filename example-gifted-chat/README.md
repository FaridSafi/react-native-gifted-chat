Lots of people using `react-native-gifted-chat` might want to know that...

1. There are so many render props could use, but what should I pass?
2. How could I customize each component, but leaving its functionality.

> For example, said that you want to customize the `send button`, when you pass your own component to `renderSend`, after that you will lose the functionality of clean up text when a message has been sent.

---

I made this for anyone who wants to know how to use the render Props properly.

##### Such as:

- renderInputToolbar
- renderActions
- renderComposer
- renderSend
- renderAvatar
- renderBubble
- renderSystemMessage
- renderMessage
- renderMessageText
- renderCustomView
